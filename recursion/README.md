Introduction
Recursion is a powerful programming technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is widely used for tasks that can be divided into smaller, repetitive tasks. In C programming, recursion can be a simple yet efficient way to approach problems such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, and tree traversals.

What is Recursion?
Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. A recursive function typically has two parts:

Base Case: The condition under which the function stops calling itself.
Recursive Case: The part of the function that includes the recursive call.
Base Case and Recursive Case
Understanding the base case and recursive case is crucial to writing a recursive function.

Base Case
The base case is the simplest, smallest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly. Without a base case, a recursive function would call itself indefinitely, leading to infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow.

Recursive Case
The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input, working towards the base case. Each recursive call should bring the function closer to the base case.

Benefits and Drawbacks
Benefits
Simplicity: Recursive solutions can be more straightforward and easier to understand than iterative ones.
Problem Decomposition: Naturally suited for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems.
Drawbacks
Memory Usage: Recursive functions can consume more memory due to the call stack.
Performance: May be slower than iterative solutions for large inputs due to overhead of multiple function calls.
Risk of Infinite Recursion: Improperly defined base cases can lead to infinite recursion.
Examples
Factorial
The factorial of a number 
ùëõ
n (denoted as 
ùëõ
!
n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 
ùëõ
n.

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // Base case
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
    }
}

int main() {
    int number = 5;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", number, factorial(number));
    return 0;
}
Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n; // Base case
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive case
    }
}

int main() {
    int number = 10;
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        printf("%d ", fibonacci(i));
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int target) {
    if (low > high) {
        return -1; // Base case: not found
    }
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == target) {
        return mid; // Base case: found
    } else if (arr[mid] > target) {
        return binarySearch(arr, low, mid - 1, target); // Recursive case
    } else {
        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, high, target); // Recursive case
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    int target = 5;
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, size - 1, target);
    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element found at index %d\n", result);
    } else {
        printf("Element not found\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem involving moving disks between rods according to specific rules.

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

void towerOfHanoi(int n, char from_rod, char to_rod, char aux_rod) {
    if (n == 1) {
        printf("Move disk 1 from rod %c to rod %c\n", from_rod, to_rod);
        return;
    }
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, from_rod, aux_rod, to_rod);
    printf("Move disk %d from rod %c to rod %c\n", n, from_rod, to_rod);
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, aux_rod, to_rod, from_rod);
}

int main() {
    int n = 3; // Number of disks
    towerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B'); // A, B, and C are names of rods
    return 0;
}
Common Mistakes
Missing Base Case: Forgetting to define a base case can lead to infinite recursion.
Incorrect Base Case: An improperly defined base case can cause incorrect results or infinite loops.
Stack Overflow: Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow due to excessive function calls.
Best Practices
Define Clear Base Case: Ensure the base case is well-defined and reachable.
Test with Small Inputs: Start with small inputs to understand the behavior of the recursive function.
Consider Iteration for Deep Recursion: For very deep recursion, consider iterative solutions or tail recursion optimization.
Use Memoization: For problems like Fibonacci where the same results are repeatedly calculated, use memoization to store and reuse results.
