verview

This repository serves as a learning resource for beginners in C programming, focusing on fundamental concepts such as variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while). Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your understanding of these concepts, this repository aims to provide clear explanations and practical examples to help you grasp these fundamental concepts.

Contents

1. **Variables**: Understand the basics of declaring variables, variable types, and how to manipulate them.
2. **If-Else Statements**: Learn how to use conditional statements to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.
3. **While Loops**: Explore how to use while loops to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
